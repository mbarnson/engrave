# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-24)

**Core value:** When Sam uploads a recording and describes his ensemble, his players can sight-read the extracted parts at rehearsal and the brass section sounds like a section.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Project Scaffolding & Inference Router

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 9 (Project Scaffolding & Inference Router) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase (all plans complete)
Status: Phase Complete
Last activity: 2026-02-24 -- Completed 01-02-PLAN.md (LilyPond compiler, parser, compile-fix loop, CLI)

Progress: [##........] 11%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 6 min
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 2 | 12 min | 6 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (6 min), 01-02 (6 min)
- Trend: Consistent

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: MIDI-first strategy -- prove code generation with clean MIDI input before adding audio complexity
- Roadmap: 9 phases derived from natural pipeline component boundaries at comprehensive depth
- Roadmap: Convergent sight-reading (Phase 7) deferred until rendering and audio understanding are stable
- 01-01: hatchling build backend for src layout support with uv
- 01-01: pydantic-settings v2 requires settings_customise_sources for TOML (not just model_config)
- 01-01: TestSettings subclass pattern for TOML path isolation in tests
- 01-01: typer (not typer[all]) -- the [all] extra removed in v0.24.x
- 01-02: Error context window: ~20 lines centered on error, full source also in prompt for complete return
- 01-02: extract_lilypond_from_response handles markdown code blocks, generic code blocks, and plain text
- 01-02: Repeated error hash detection after first occurrence triggers early loop exit

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- basic-pitch HARD CONSTRAINT: requires Python 3.10 isolated venv on Apple Silicon (official support 3.8-3.11 only, frozen since Aug 2024). Phase 5 must implement subprocess invocation or venv isolation to run basic-pitch alongside the Python 3.12 project.
- LilyPond LLM generation quality ceiling unknown -- benchmark models early in Phase 3
- RAG corpus is mostly classical (Mutopia); big band jazz coverage is sparse until Sam's charts are added (v1.1)
